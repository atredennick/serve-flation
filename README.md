# serve-flation
Code for analysis of serve speeds. My write-up is on LinkedIn: [Is Iga Świątek keeping up with serve-flation?](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/iga-%C5%9Bwi%C4%85tek-keeping-up-serve-flation-andrew-tredennick-c3lyc/)

The full analysis is done in `serve-flation.qmd`, with a few helper functions and data wrangling in the `./scripts` directory.
